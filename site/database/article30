Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, has rejected claims that 13 of his country’s citizens carried out an audacious plot to influence the 2016 US election in favour of Donald Trump.

Mr Lavrov dismissed the allegations as “blabber” after US prosecutors filed an indictment yesterday that gave the most vivid glimpse yet of the scale and sophistication of Russian efforts to “sow chaos” in US democracy.

Appearing at the Munich Security Conference, Mr Lavrov was asked for his response to the development. He said: “I don’t have a reaction because anything and everything can be published. We see how accusations, statements, are multiplying.”
