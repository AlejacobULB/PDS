Lizzy Yarnold won a gold medal in the women's skeleton at the Pyeongchang 2018, with team-mate Laura Deas taking bronze on Great Britain’s most successful day in Winter Olympics history.

Yarnold, who clocked in at 3:27.28, also becomes the first ever British athlete to successfully defend an Winter Olympics title, after she won gold in Sochi four years ago.

She is Team GB’s first gold medallist at the Pyeongchang Games and becomes Britain's most decorated Winter Olympian.

Britain have now equalled their record Winter Games medal tally of four – and there are plenty of further opportunities to come.

Deas meanwhile won bronze at her first appearance at a Winter Olympics – the first time that two British athletes have finished on the podium at a Winter Games.

It is the first time ever Britain have won three Winter Olympic medals in the same day, overtaking the record two from Chamonix in 1924.

It is also the first time that Team GB has won three medals on one day at the Winter Olympics, after Izzy Atkin earlier won bronze in the ski slopestyle final.

Yarnold trailed by 0.10 overnight after complaining of being dizzy, but cut the deficit as overnight leader Jacqueline Loelling of Germany slipped back to third place after the third run.

The Briton trailed Flock by 0.02 ahead of the fourth and final run, meaning Yarnold was the penultimate slider to take to the track and had to watch her rival's run.

Yarnold clocked a track record of 51.46 to lead by a commanding fashion and Flock floundered, relinquishing her spot on the podium to spark jubilant celebrations among a sizeable British contingent at the Olympic Sliding Centre.
