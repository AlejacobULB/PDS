GANGNEUNG, South Korea — It was a night for Cold War nostalgia and present-day geopolitical angst, a night for feisty, post-whistle scraps in the corners and for cheap jokes on Twitter — Boy, that last two minutes sure was an indictment of the Russian power play, am I right? It was a night drenched in history at the start and simmering with ill feeling at the end. It was a night for wild flag-waving and raucous chanting, for a little arena on an Asian peninsula to get its roof blown off for a hockey game, of all things.

It was even a night for competitive hockey, even if the scoreboard suggested a beatdown. The Americans were fast, physical and relentless. They outshot the Olympic Athletes from Russia. But they were a ramshackle band of college kids, minor leaguers and retirees. They were playing grizzled KHL veterans and former NHL stars. The difference in skill — passing, stick-handling, finishing — was roughly the size of Siberia, and that is what the scoreboard showed.

The team of Russians outclassed the United States, 4-0, Saturday at Gangneung Hockey Center in the group stage of the Olympic hockey tournament. The final two Russian goals, the ones that turned an antagonistic scrap into a rout, came off the stick of Ilya Kovalchuk, a 34-year-old who once signed a $102-million NHL contract. The U.S. may have mega-prospect Jordan Greenway, but with the NHLers back in North America on Commissioner Gary Bettman’s decree, it doesn’t have anybody like Kovalchuk.

It does have a backbone. In the final seconds of the blowout, Russian coach Oleg Zinarok reinserted his first line, providing Kovalchuck a chance at a hat trick and poking the U.S. in the eye. Asked later if he was upset at the tactic, U.S. Coach Tony Donato said, sternly, “Yes.” In the moment, Greenway ended up in another tussle, the last a night-long series.
