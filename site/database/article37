South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Saturday it was too early to talk about hosting a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, hinting he would not rush the matter.

A high-level delegation from the North invited Moon to Pyongyang for talks with his North Korean counterpart while in South Korea last week for the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
The delegation's unprecedented visit was hailed in some quarters as a diplomatic breakthrough, but Moon must now chart a way through tricky diplomatic waters.
"There are high expectations and our hearts seem to be getting impatient. It is like the old saying, seeking a scorched-rice water from a well," Moon told journalists in Pyeongchang after being asked whether he planned to hold a summit with North Korea.

The proverb translates to rushing into something without fully understanding the consequences.
