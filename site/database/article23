Henry Bolton has been ejected as the leader of Ukip at an emergency conference, throwing the future of the party into further uncertainty.

The decision at the crisis meeting of around Ukip members gathered in Birmingham came after the party’s ruling body – the National Executive Body (NEC) - voted no confidence in the 54-year-old leadership last month.

After Mr Bolton refused to step down, he was forced to make his case to the membership on Saturday, but he lost the no confidence motion by 867 to 500 votes.

Following the announcement of the result Mr Bolton said he was "disappointed", but added: "I have not finished in politics yet."

The party now faces the a fourth leadership contest in 18 months while Ukip MEP Gerard Batten will act as interim leader.

Mr Bolton, a former soldier, who was not paid for his role as Ukip leader, won the position at the helm of the party last September on a platform to professionalise the party and bring together warring factions in Ukip.

Mr Bolton’s leadership has been in the spotlight due his relationship with Jo Marney, who sent racist messages about Prince Harry’s fiancé Meghan Markle.

And on Friday Mr Bolton criticised the media scrutiny into his private life following the breakdown of his marriage to Tatiana Smurova and his new relationship with Ms Marney.

Describing the media interest, he told Sky News: “There’s probably been nothing like that since the Profumo affair or Diana and Dodi (Fayed).”

Questions will inevitably be raised as to whether the party - hit by bitter in-fighting, resignations and financial uncertainty in recent months – has a future beyond Mr Bolton’s leadership.
