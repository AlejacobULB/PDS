Wrapped in a mustard coloured blanket with a white scarf and her head on one side, Pablo Picasso’s La Misereuse Accroupie (The Crouching Beggar) is a study of forlorn resignation. But researchers say that there is more to desolate character than meets the eye.

Beneath the mournful image lies another painting, a landscape, researchers have revealed after using non-invasive imaging techniques to examine the work.

The study has also shed light on previously hidden features of Picasso’s early attempts at his desolate figure.

“This is where technology allows us to get into the mind of the artist, so we can actually understand the creative process of Picasso and how he actually started producing this work of art,” said Marc Walton of Northwestern University, who is presenting the work at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Texas.

La Misereuse Accroupie was painted by Picasso in 1902, during Picasso’s early “blue period”. It currently hangs in the the Art Gallery of Ontario, Canada.

The first secrets of the painting were discovered by conservators in 1992. Eagle-eyed experts had noticed that the surface texture of parts of Picasso’s painting seemed at odds with the brush strokes of the figure. “There is also unrelated colour peeking through the cracklines that always suggests either a change in composition or a reused canvas,” added Sandra Webster-Cook, senior conservator of paintings at the Art Gallery of Ontario.
