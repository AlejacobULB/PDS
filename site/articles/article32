NHS manager numbers have risen by a quarter in five years and are higher than before the implementation of reforms designed to cut bureaucracy.

The increase in administrative staff far outstrips that for doctors and nurses over the same period, provoking anger from health unions.

More than 6,000 managers have been hired since April 2013 when controversial reforms by Andrew Lansley, then health secretary, came into effect, abolishing more than 150 NHS organisations and making thousands redundant.
