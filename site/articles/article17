<Austin, TX>Renowned radio show host and fake news creator Alex Jones has reportedly asked his audience to fly the false flag at half-staff today in honor of the Texas shooting victims.  Jones’ request comes after a gunman opened fire on the parishioners of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas killing more than 20 and injuring dozens more.  While details of the shooter have not been released, Alex is likely spinning up all kinds of untruths in order to satisfy his legion of brain-dead followers.

“Was the shooter a Muslim?  Antifa?  BLM?  Was he radicalized by the gay agenda?  Why did he hate Christians?  Is there really even a church in Sutherland Springs?  Are these the same crisis actors used during the Vegas shooting?  Did you see that Craigslist ad recently seeking extras for a mass casualty exercise?  How was Hillary involved?  Could Obama have done more to prevent this attack?  Did some crazed liberal shoot up this church to blame Trump and take away our guns?  If this story is even true why did none of the parishioners shoot back?,” Alex likely opined during this afternoons editorial meeting.

This is a developing story.  Please check back for additional information.
