or two years, Donald Trump — as both candidate and president — has frequently dismissed the notion of Russian meddling in U.S. elections as a "hoax" and even denigrated heads of U.S. intelligence agencies for suggesting otherwise.

At times he has also taken Russian President Vladimir Putin's word on the issue.

That view hit choppy waters this week with the FBI indictment of 13 Russian nationals for alleged cyber-meddling.

Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, added a few waves as the highest ranking White House official to say flatly on Saturday that evidence of Russian election meddling "is now incontrovertible.”

The president has not formally commented on the meddling aspect of the FBI's allegations, preferring to claim instead that they prove there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign and show that the outcome of the election was not affected. The indictments took no position on either issue.
